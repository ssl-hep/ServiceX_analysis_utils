# ServiceX Analysis Utilities

This package provides tools interacting with [ServiceX](https://github.com/ssl-hep/ServiceX_frontend), a data extraction, transformation and delivery system built for ATLAS and CMS analyses on large datasets. The Analysis Utils package offers helper functions that streamline the usage of ServiceX and simplify its integration on workflows. But it also contains specific use case tools that benefit from the service. 

It offers functions for:
- Materializing ´servicex.deliver()´ results 
- Retrieving and displaying file structures from datasets remotely with branch filtering.
